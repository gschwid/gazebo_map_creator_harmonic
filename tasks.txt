First steps in the project

1) Create an occupancy grid of gazeebo world
- Scan all collisions in the world
    - This method might not work depending on how collisions are defined in the file. 
- Do math to figure out how to create occupancy grid from this
- Likely store all the occupancy values in an array, then take this array and publish it in a ROS2 message. 

2) Go from occupancy to 3d.
